### Solution

Shown in the two pie charts are the qualifications of staff at an engineering company, and two years – 1988 and 2008 – are studied. Overall, there are **noticeable** similarities and **apparent** differences in terms of the different levels of education reached by employees.

**Substantial** differences could be found in the proportion of employees **obtain**ing PHD-Science degree, First Degree of Art and First Degree of Sciences. The year of 2008 witnessed that employees with PHD-Science degree accounted for the greatest proportions, 17% higher than 1988’s 13%. Conversely, the two remainders saw a marked **shrinkage**, with the percentage **slump**ing by 13% and 9% respectively. 

By contrast, staff with Master’s Degree of both Science and Art and PHD Art degree had **marginal** changes in 2008, compared with their respective shares in 1988. Most notably, the Master Science sector, **stabilizing** at 29%, was larger than the other sectors in 1988 and became the second largest in 2008. In addition, PHD Art holders **constitute**d the smallest part of the total workforce.

Overall, the two years differed greatly.
