### Solution

The pie charts illustrate the amount of water consumed in the production of agricultural products as well as the corresponding amount of money earned in 2004.

Dairy making was not only a large water consumer but also a great **contributor** of agricultural income. Roughly one third of water consumption was **attributed to** it, and so is the case with the money earned. Meanwhile, a similar situation was found in the production of fruit. **Distinct from** these two sectors, growing rice consumed a small portion of water (4%) and gained a limited proportion of earnings (1%).

Water consumed by crops, vegetables and sugar were at low levels, whereas the incomes were at high levels. The opposite is the case with livestock. When it comes to crops, vegetables and sugar, the proportions of their **contributions** to total income were larger than those of water consumption, with the gap ranging from 7% and 12%. In terms of livestock, its earnings, in percentage terms, were one-ninth of its water consumption, which **dominated** in the total water use.

Overall, it is notable that livestock took the **dominant** position in the water use, while it is dairy and fruit that earned the largest proportion of income.
