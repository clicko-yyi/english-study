### Solution

The maps demonstrate the original layout of a **library** five years ago and how it looks like at present.

Overall, the maps indicate that the library **has witnessed noticeable changes** during the given period. Especially, there has been more space for self-study.

It is clear that five years ago, two groups of bookshelves were located **on the northern and southern side**, **with** 5 desks **in the central part of** the library. Currently, although the **former** bookshelves in the north have **remained unchanged**, those **on the southern part** **have been replaced by** a separate laptop room. Meanwhile, the **initial** study area **has been expanded**.

Looking at the western part, we can see that five years ago, there was a meeting room between a classroom and an area for borrowing-and-returning books. At present, although the meeting room **still exists**, the room on the south of it has **been transferred into** a single area for borrowing books, and a newly-built audio area has **replaced** the **original** classroom. Also, **we can see the addition of** a room for returning books **on the southwestern corner**. Meanwhile, from the first map we can find that **along the eastern side** of the library was a computer room, **with** the Library Office **lying** on the southeastern corner. However, these two sections **have been demolished to make way for** a study room for students with laptop and a conference room.
