### Solution

It is notable that the village is divided into two parts by a main street, which extends from the southwest to the northeast. Today, visitors, after driving from the southwest corner, will soon find that the original road on the left of the main street connected to a T-shaped road on the north, and the connection between these roads provide access to the **expanded** residential area. Then, they will no longer find the original restaurant and the hotel further along the street but instead immediately see these regions **vacant**. Meanwhile, on the other side of the street, there have been more **substantial** changes. Where there used to be a pub and a shoe factory, there **features** a playground. In addition, as the replacement of the farm, the vast piece of farmland and the shop, increasingly more houses **have been erected**, occupying most of the land.

Overall, the village is **enormously** different from it was in 2000.
