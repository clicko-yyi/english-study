### Question

Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

### Solution

There is currently a discussion in modern society regarding whether paying taxes is adequate in terms of community contribution or if citizenship entails additional responsibilities. While some individuals maintain that tax payment is satisfactory, others contend that citizens are obligated to do more. This essay will explore both perspectives and provide my personal stance.

On the one hand, those who believe that paying taxes is enough to contribute to society argue that taxes are the primary source of funding for public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. They argue that by paying taxes, citizens are fulfilling their obligation to support the government and contribute to the common good. Furthermore, they argue that paying taxes is a legal requirement, and therefore, it is the only responsibility that citizens have.

On the other hand, others believe that citizens have a moral obligation to make a contribution to society beyond paying taxes. One of the most important responsibilities of a citizen is to participate in the democratic process. This means voting in elections, staying informed about political issues, and engaging in public discourse. By doing so, citizens can help shape the policies and decisions that affect their lives and the lives of others. On top of that, being a citizen also involves contributing to the welfare of society, such as volunteering, donating to charity, and helping those in need. Then, citizens can make a positive impact on their communities and help improve the lives of others.

As far as I am concerned, although fulfilling tax obligations is a crucial duty of individuals, it is insufficient to make a meaningful impact on society. It is incumbent upon citizens to go beyond tax payments and take on a moral responsibility to actively engage in their communities, offer their time and resources as volunteers, and participate in political activism. Through these actions, citizens can play a role in building a fairer and more equitable society.

In conclusion, I believe citizens have a moral obligation to contribute to society beyond paying taxes.
