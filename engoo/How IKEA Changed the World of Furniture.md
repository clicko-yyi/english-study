How IKEA Changed the World of Furniture

In 1931, 5-year-old Ingvar Kamprad started selling matches to his neighbors in the Swedish countryside.

As he grew older, Kamprad started selling more things — like Christmas cards and pens — both in his village and at school.

And in 1943, at the age of 17, he founded a company called IKEA.

The name was made up of his initials, as well as the initials for Elmtaryd, the name of his family farm, and Agunnaryd, the village close to where he lived.

At first, Kamprad sold things like picture frames and wallets over the telephone. In 1948, he started selling cheap furniture, and he published IKEA's first catalog two years later.

However, some people doubted that such cheap furniture could be of good quality. So, in 1953, Kamprad opened a showroom where customers could see the furniture and place orders in person.

The company's breakthrough came in 1956, when Kamprad introduced the idea of flat-packing furniture to save on shipping costs.

And in 1958, the first IKEA store opened in Älmhult, a larger town near Agunnaryd.

The company was doing well, increasing its sales from less than $150,000 to more than $600,000 in just three years.

But competitors weren't happy with IKEA's low prices, and threatened to boycott Swedish suppliers that continued to sell to IKEA. With a growing company and few suppliers willing to work with him, Kamprad had to get creative.

IKEA started designing its own furniture, creating its signature look. It also began working with foreign suppliers, starting with Denmark and Poland.

The first store outside Sweden opened in Norway in 1963, making IKEA an international retailer. By the 1970s, IKEA was opening stores everywhere from Canada to Japan.

Kamprad died in 2018 aged 91, leaving behind a company that as of February 15, 2023, has 460 stores in 62 countries.
