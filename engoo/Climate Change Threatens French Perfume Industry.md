# Climate Change Threatens French Perfume Industry

Climate change is already affecting the whole world, bringing us warmer and more extreme weather. And in southeastern France, changes in summer heat, winter cold and the amount of rain are testing the area's famous perfume industry.

The town of Grasse, just northwest of Cannes, is known as the capital of the industry. In 2018, UNESCO added the area's perfume making to its list of global cultural heritage.

But farmers in Grasse are growing worried about how colder winters and stronger storms are affecting the flowers they use to make their perfumes.

Lavender, a sweet-smelling purple flower, has been grown for perfume in southeastern France for hundreds of years. But recent water shortages have reduced the growth of these and other plants, Ana Ripoll of perfume maker Iberchem told *Cosmetics Business*.

And *The Guardian* wrote that a very dry summer in 2022 caused some farmers in Grasse to lose almost half of their flowers.

Farmers of perfume ingredients in other countries are also being affected by climate change.

Madagascar, for example, is the world's biggest producer of vanilla. The price of vanilla increased to over $600 per kilogram — higher than the price of silver — after storms in the country in 2017, *Luxury Tribune* wrote.

As their problems grow, some perfume makers in France are thinking of using synthetic ingredients. Others are looking to "vertical farming" — growing plants on top of each other, usually indoors, for greater efficiency.

In late 2021, Swiss perfume company Firmenich announced that it had already worked with a French vertical farming company to grow some of its plants in vertical farms.
