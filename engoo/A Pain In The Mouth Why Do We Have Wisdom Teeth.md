# A Pain In The Mouth: Why Do We Have Wisdom Teeth

On our 18th birthdays we might get a cake and a card, maybe a special gift.

But there is an unwanted and sometimes painful present that many of us get at that time of life — wisdom teeth.

They usually come between the ages of 17 and 25 and there are usually four at the back of your mouth. They're known as wisdom teeth because they arrive at a time when we might be beginning to feel wise.

Although, some studies have said that only a little more than half of people get their wisdom teeth at all.

For those that do, they can cause a lot of pain as they break through the gums and try to find a space in the corners of our mouths — and dentists may recommend removing them.

So if we don't really need them, why do we have them?

Well, the answer that most experts give is that we may not need them now, but our ancestors did.

That's because they ate tough, uncooked foods — things like meat, plants and nuts. So having wisdom teeth helped them grind the foods down to make them easier to eat.

Of course, now we cook many of these tougher foods to make them softer, so we don't need to work so hard with our teeth.

And over time, our jaws have become smaller. There's often still space for the wisdom teeth to grow in the jaw yet not quite enough for them to erupt in the mouth — and that's often the reason for the pain.

口腔疼痛：为什么我们长智齿

在我们 18 岁生日那天，我们可能会得到一个蛋糕和一张卡片，也许是一份特别的礼物。但是，我们中的许多人在生命的那个阶段都有一个不想要的、有时甚至是痛苦的礼物——智齿。他们通常在 17 到 25 岁之间生长，通常有四个在你的嘴巴后面。它们被称为智齿，因为它们出现在我们可能开始觉得自己聪明的时候。虽然，一些研究表明，只有略多于一半的人会长出智齿。对于那些长智齿人来说，当它们突破牙龈并试图在我们的嘴角找到一个空间时，它们会引起很多疼痛——牙医可能会建议将它们移除。所以，如果我们真的不需要它们，我们为什么要拥有它们？好吧，大多数专家给出的答案是，我们现在可能不需要它们，但我们的祖先需要。那是因为他们吃坚硬的、生的食物——比如肉、植物和坚果。所以长智齿可以帮助他们把食物磨碎，这样吃起来更容易。当然，现在我们把很多这些比较硬的食物煮得比较软，这样我们就不需要用牙齿那么辛苦了。随着时间的推移，我们的下巴变小了。智齿通常仍有空间在下巴中生长，但还不足以让它们在口腔中萌出。 这通常是疼痛的原因。
