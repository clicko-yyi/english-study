# A Pain In The Mouth: Why Do We Have Wisdom Teeth

On our 18th birthdays we might get a cake and a card, maybe a special gift.

But there is an unwanted and sometimes painful present that many of us get at that time of life — wisdom teeth.

They usually come between the ages of 17 and 25 and there are usually four at the back of your mouth. They're known as wisdom teeth because they arrive at a time when we might be beginning to feel wise.

Although, some studies have said that only a little more than half of people get their wisdom teeth at all.

For those that do, they can cause a lot of pain as they break through the gums and try to find a space in the corners of our mouths — and dentists may recommend removing them.

So if we don't really need them, why do we have them?

Well, the answer that most experts give is that we may not need them now, but our ancestors did.

That's because they ate tough, uncooked foods — things like meat, plants and nuts. So having wisdom teeth helped them grind the foods down to make them easier to eat.

Of course, now we cook many of these tougher foods to make them softer, so we don't need to work so hard with our teeth.

And over time, our jaws have become smaller. There's often still space for the wisdom teeth to grow in the jaw yet not quite enough for them to erupt in the mouth — and that's often the reason for the pain.

# Climate Change Threatens French Perfume Industry

Climate change is already affecting the whole world, bringing us warmer and more extreme weather. And in southeastern France, changes in summer heat, winter cold and the amount of rain are testing the area's famous perfume industry.

The town of Grasse, just northwest of Cannes, is known as the capital of the industry. In 2018, UNESCO added the area's perfume making to its list of global cultural heritage.

But farmers in Grasse are growing worried about how colder winters and stronger storms are affecting the flowers they use to make their perfumes.

Lavender, a sweet-smelling purple flower, has been grown for perfume in southeastern France for hundreds of years. But recent water shortages have reduced the growth of these and other plants, Ana Ripoll of perfume maker Iberchem told *Cosmetics Business*.

And *The Guardian* wrote that a very dry summer in 2022 caused some farmers in Grasse to lose almost half of their flowers.

Farmers of perfume ingredients in other countries are also being affected by climate change.

Madagascar, for example, is the world's biggest producer of vanilla. The price of vanilla increased to over $600 per kilogram — higher than the price of silver — after storms in the country in 2017, *Luxury Tribune* wrote.

As their problems grow, some perfume makers in France are thinking of using synthetic ingredients. Others are looking to "vertical farming" — growing plants on top of each other, usually indoors, for greater efficiency.

In late 2021, Swiss perfume company Firmenich announced that it had already worked with a French vertical farming company to grow some of its plants in vertical farms.

# Hong Kong Giving Away 500,000 Free Plane Tickets

Hong Kong Giving Away 500,000 Free Plane Tickets

There are some tourist destinations that sell themselves — they hardly need to be advertised.

But other places need to be a little more creative.

That's the situation that Hong Kong has found itself in after a long shutdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The solution? Well, it's creative and it's also very expensive. As part of a campaign called "Hello Hong Kong," the government is giving away 500,000 free airplane flights to encourage tourists to come back to the city.

According to *CNN*, it's costing about $250 million. Tickets will be available with three Hong Kong airlines: Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines and HK Express.

The city began its pandemic shutdown in January 2020, and didn't really begin reopening to the world until September 2022. By that time, a number of businesses had closed and tourist numbers fell from more than 50 million a year to around 100,000.

But the free flights will not be available to everyone right away.

From the start of March 2023, travelers in Southeast Asia will be able to put their names into a lottery for the flights.

At the beginning of April, the lottery will be open to people in mainland China, and from May 1, tourists from anywhere in the world will be able to enter. Some free flights will also be made available to people in Hong Kong who wish to travel abroad.

Although some bars and restaurants closed during the pandemic, the government says there are now new things for tourists to see in the city — such as the Hong Kong Palace Museum, which opened in July 2022.

# Japan and Mexico: Places Twitter Users Miss Most

Many of us miss our home countries when we spend time abroad - when we are at home, we might miss faraway places where we had great vacations. Years later, we might post photograph on social media to remember absent friends and favorite locations.

A study of over 1.5 million tweets has shown that Japan is the country the Twitter users miss the most, while the New York is the most missed city.

A company offering international payments and similar service, looked at tweets in the four common languages on Twitter: English, Japanese, Spanish and Portuguese. It searched tweets posted between November 2017 and November 2022 for phrases such as "i miss" and "wish i was in" before the name of a country or city.

Japan was mentioned as being missed over 68,000 times in the tweets  - nearly 14% of the total mentions of countries being missed.

Japan has a "welcoming culture," good public transport and excellent food, Remilty Said. "With a worldwide reputation for being friendly and polite, it's not hard to see why this country could top the rankings."

The second most missed country was Mexico, with close to 48,000 mentions in tweets. Next came the United States, South Korea and Italy.

However, nearly 92,000 tweets mentioned missing New York - even more than Japan. The Big Apple - as New York is sometimes known - was followed by Los Angeles, London, Chicago and Tokyo.

# Survey: 30% of European Workers Want More Remote Days.

While working from home isn't uncommon these days, a survey has found that some workers wish they could do it more often — and would even change jobs to be able to do so.

Between 2020 and 2022, the European Central Bank (ECB) asked people from European countries about their working preferences.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey found that over 60% of workers had never worked from home. A few months into the pandemic, however, this decreased to under 40%.

And in May 2022, more than half of participants said they'd worked from home at least one day per week in the previous three months.

When asked about their preferences in August 2021, about 40% said they wanted to work remotely for at least two days a week after the pandemic, with 27% expecting their employers to allow them to.

And while most participants said their expectations were in line with what they thought their employers would allow, about 30% said they wanted to work from home more than they thought their companies would like.

Those who wanted to work from home more often were also much more likely to have changed jobs at least once while the survey was being done.

The most common reason for wanting more remote work days was commute time. People with commutes longer than an hour wanted many more work-from-home days than those with shorter commutes.
