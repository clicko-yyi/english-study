# Are Robot Waiters the Future?

You may have already seen them in restaurants: robots that greet guests, lead them to their tables and deliver their meals.

Sales of robot waiters have been growing in recent years, with tens of thousands now working worldwide. But are robot waiters the future?

In a recent US survey, 62% of restaurant operators said they don't have enough employees — and many think robots are the solution to this shortage.

But others say it will be a long time before robot waiters can replace humans. Robots can't take orders, and they can't manage steps or other physical challenges.

Still, the robots are spreading.

Li Zhai was having trouble finding staff for his Michigan restaurant, so he bought three robots. Now, one robot leads diners to their seats, another delivers bowls of noodles to tables, while a third carries dirty dishes back to the kitchen.

Zhai only needs three people to do the same work that five or six people once did. And while a robot costs around $15,000, a person costs $5,000 to $6,000 per month.

Zhai said the robots give human servers more time with customers, which increases tips. And customers post videos of the robots on social media — and that brings more business.

Marcus Merritt was surprised to see a robot server at a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Atlanta recently.

"I think technology is part of our normal everyday now," he said. "Everybody uses some form of computer. It's a natural progression."

However, Saru Jayaraman, president of the One Fair Wage organization, said restaurants could easily solve their labor shortages if they paid workers more.

"Humans don't go to a full-service restaurant to be served by technology," she said. "They go for the experience of themselves and the people they care about being served by a human."
