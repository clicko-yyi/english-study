Survey Reveals the Best Cities for Public Transport

The German capital of Berlin has lots of historical landmarks, music and culture — and, according to a recent survey, the best public transport in the world.

*Time Out* asked over 20,000 people living in more than 50 cities around the world how easy it is to get around their city by public transport.

Participants also shared how they feel about the public transport system in their cities, such as how comfortable or safe it is, and even how beautiful their stations are.

*Time Out* then put together a list of the top cities with the best public transport in the world.

Although over 50 cities were included in the survey, only 19 were good enough to be included in the final list — with at least 80% of residents agreeing that it's easy to get around using public transport.

And interestingly, the top 10 cities are all in Asia and Europe.

Berlin took the top spot, with 97% of residents saying positive things about the city's public transport system. Prague in the Czech Republic was a close second with 96%.

In third place was Tokyo, with 94% of residents praising its public transport. This might not be surprising — Japan's public transport is known around the world for being punctual and efficient, and Tokyo is often found on lists of the best public transport systems.

Further down the list, in fifth place, residents of the Swedish capital, Stockholm, praised the city's beautiful subway stations.
