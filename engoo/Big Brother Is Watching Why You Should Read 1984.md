# Big Brother Is Watching: Why You Should Read *1984*

Imagine a world where everything you do is controlled. Whether you're eating, sleeping or just going for a walk, somebody is always watching.

In George Orwell's *1984*, that "somebody" is Big Brother, the leader of a totalitarian state called Oceania.

The year is 1984, and in this dystopian world, the government — called the Party — has complete control over everything, including people's thoughts and actions.

Free thinking — "thoughtcrime" — is punished, while language is simplified into "newspeak," designed to limit the ability to discuss complex ideas and to think critically.

The Party's slogans read: "War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."

These are examples of what Orwell calls "doublethink" — the ability to hold two contradictory beliefs at once — and also examples of how propaganda and false information are spread by the Party.

Although it wasn't the first dystopian novel, *1984* might be the most famous.

Like many other works of dystopian fiction, it serves as a warning to its readers: it aims to show the extreme consequences of a government that has complete power, and encourage people to protect their individuality and personal freedoms.

Orwell — whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair — published *1984* in 1949, and it was his last novel.

Many of his novels had political themes, largely inspired by real-world events during his lifetime, including the Spanish Civil War — which he both wrote about and fought in — and World War II.

One of Orwell's main purposes for writing was a desire to "push the world in a certain direction, to alter other people's idea of the kind of society that they should strive after," as he explained in his essay *Why I Write*, three years before *1984* was released.

Orwell died in 1950, but much of what he wrote about has been compared to our world today.

From mass surveillance to the spread of fake news and personalized propaganda, or even the simplified language people use when texting, some believe *1984* may no longer be just fiction — and we've let it happen.
