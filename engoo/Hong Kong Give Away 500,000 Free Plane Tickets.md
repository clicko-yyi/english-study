Hong Kong Giving Away 500,000 Free Plane Tickets

There are some tourist destinations that sell themselves — they hardly need to be advertised.

But other places need to be a little more creative.

That's the situation that Hong Kong has found itself in after a long shutdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The solution? Well, it's creative and it's also very expensive. As part of a campaign called "Hello Hong Kong," the government is giving away 500,000 free airplane flights to encourage tourists to come back to the city.

According to *CNN*, it's costing about $250 million. Tickets will be available with three Hong Kong airlines: Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines and HK Express.

The city began its pandemic shutdown in January 2020, and didn't really begin reopening to the world until September 2022. By that time, a number of businesses had closed and tourist numbers fell from more than 50 million a year to around 100,000.

But the free flights will not be available to everyone right away.

From the start of March 2023, travelers in Southeast Asia will be able to put their names into a lottery for the flights.

At the beginning of April, the lottery will be open to people in mainland China, and from May 1, tourists from anywhere in the world will be able to enter. Some free flights will also be made available to people in Hong Kong who wish to travel abroad.

Although some bars and restaurants closed during the pandemic, the government says there are now new things for tourists to see in the city — such as the Hong Kong Palace Museum, which opened in July 2022.
