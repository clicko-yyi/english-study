# Japan and Mexico: Places Twitter Users Miss Most

Many of us miss our home countries when we spend time abroad - when we are at home, we might miss faraway places where we had great vacations. Years later, we might post photograph on social media to remember absent friends and favorite locations.

A study of over 1.5 million tweets has shown that Japan is the country the Twitter users miss the most, while the New York is the most missed city.

A company offering international payments and similar service, looked at tweets in the four common languages on Twitter: English, Japanese, Spanish and Portuguese. It searched tweets posted between November 2017 and November 2022 for phrases such as "i miss" and "wish i was in" before the name of a country or city.

Japan was mentioned as being missed over 68,000 times in the tweets  - nearly 14% of the total mentions of countries being missed.

Japan has a "welcoming culture," good public transport and excellent food, Remilty Said. "With a worldwide reputation for being friendly and polite, it's not hard to see why this country could top the rankings."

The second most missed country was Mexico, with close to 48,000 mentions in tweets. Next came the United States, South Korea and Italy.

However, nearly 92,000 tweets mentioned missing New York - even more than Japan. The Big Apple - as New York is sometimes known - was followed by Los Angeles, London, Chicago and Tokyo.
