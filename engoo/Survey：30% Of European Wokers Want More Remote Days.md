# Survey: 30% of European Workers Want More Remote Days.

While working from home isn't uncommon these days, a survey has found that some workers wish they could do it more often — and would even change jobs to be able to do so.

Between 2020 and 2022, the European Central Bank (ECB) asked people from European countries about their working preferences.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey found that over 60% of workers had never worked from home. A few months into the pandemic, however, this decreased to under 40%.

And in May 2022, more than half of participants said they'd worked from home at least one day per week in the previous three months.

When asked about their preferences in August 2021, about 40% said they wanted to work remotely for at least two days a week after the pandemic, with 27% expecting their employers to allow them to.

And while most participants said their expectations were in line with what they thought their employers would allow, about 30% said they wanted to work from home more than they thought their companies would like.

Those who wanted to work from home more often were also much more likely to have changed jobs at least once while the survey was being done.

The most common reason for wanting more remote work days was commute time. People with commutes longer than an hour wanted many more work-from-home days than those with shorter commutes.
